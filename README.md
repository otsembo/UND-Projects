# UND PROJECTS
    Hey there, so I decided to take up the Udacity Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree to upskill myself.
    
    This repository will be used to store all the official projects from the course work. Feel free to give me a heads up on what's going good and what you feel I can adjust.
